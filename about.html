<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I design and build objects as I think they deserve to be: 
Beautiful, strong and timeless.</p>

<p>The things I make are not designed to sit on a shelf and look pretty, 
they are designed to be admired while you use them. To feel comfortable and 
look great when you hold them. They are made from simple, durable, materials
that will withstand a lifetime of everyday use.</p>

<p>They are designed to take on a patina that reflects how you use them, and 
so to become more yours over time. They are designed to get better with age.</p>

<p>I started out making things for myself. If I didn't like the way a pen felt,
or the way a stereo worked I would always be tempted to make a version of it
that I felt was as close to ideal as possible... After a while these designs
started becoming realities, and as soon as other people saw the things I had made
they started asking if they could have one, and everything just grew from there.</p>

<p>Today I specialize in designing and building custom objects to meet either
my own needs, or the needs of a specific individual. Some of the designs are available
for purchase on a short-run basis, no more than 200 of a particular item is ever made.</p>

<p>My logo is my signature because I will never sell anything that I would not wish to
have associated with my name. My signature is on every item I sell because I personally
make each one by hand. I am able to stand behind each one with a lifetime warranty
because I build things to last, not to be cheap.</p>

<p>If you would like me to make something for you, please <a href="/contact.html">contact me.</a></p>

<p>-A. Gough</p>
