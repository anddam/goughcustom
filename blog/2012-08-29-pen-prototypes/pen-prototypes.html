        <h2>EDC pen prototypes</h2>
        <p>A few weeks ago I decided I wanted a nice pen that I could keep in my pocket at all times. As an exercise I thought I would design and make one for myself out of aluminum. Well that simple thought has now transitioned into the search for my perfect pen! I've made 3 prototypes so far, each a little closer to the ideal than the last.</p>
        <p>The first pen is relatively similar to something you could go and buy at a normal store. Unfortunately these familiar features are it's failures in my eyes. It has a cap which is easy to lose, it uses unreliable gel-ink cartridges and because of it's too-large diameter it is relatively uncomfortable to hold...</p>
        <img class="content_image"  src="/blog/2012-08-29-pen-prototypes/01-initial-prototype.jpg"/>
        <p>After using the first pen for a few days and cataloguing its shortcomings I decided to have another go at it. The new pen was designed around the 'Inka Travel Pen' cartridge, which is actually a miniature 'space-pen' cartridge, which is reliable and well-tested. The material choice for the pen was the same 6061-T6 aluminum as it is durable and attractive. The dimensions of the pen were able to be better designed because the cartridge was smaller, I tried out a bunch of different pens and then settled on a grip diameter of 0.375" and a barrel diameter of 0.35". I decided to stay with the knurling for the grip as I like the look of it, and it can be made comfortable quite easily by simply sanding off the top sharp edges of the knurl after it's cut.</p>
        <p>Rather than a normal cap I decided to go with a 'twist' mechanism. Basically you unscrew the barrel of the pen from the grip a little, and this action retracts the ink cartridge. Some teflon tape on the mechanism threads give it an incredibly smooth and pleasant feel.</p>
        <img class="content_image"  src="/blog/2012-08-29-pen-prototypes/02-screw-prototype.jpg"/>
        <p>This version overall feels pretty good, however it's actually <em>too</em> light! Because it's so light it doesn't have that feel that unconsciously tells you 'quality'. So I decided to make another version using steel, with the grip made of brass for a little contrast:</p>

        <img class="content_image"  src="/blog/2012-08-29-pen-prototypes/04-brass-screw-prototype-detail.jpg"/>
        <p>The most recent version feels much better in the hand. It has a solid feel to it that for some reason seems more comfortable to me. I also quite like the two-tone effect, although the brass is actually a little too clean and 'golden' at the moment. Being too close to gold in colour makes it look a little tacky in my opinion. I'm going to wait a few weeks to see what patina the brass takes on with some time, if it doesn't get dark enough for my taste then I may try using bronze instead.</p>
        <p>That's all for now, mainly just wanted to document some of the design work that's gone into this so far.</p>
