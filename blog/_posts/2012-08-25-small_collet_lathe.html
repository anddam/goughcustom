title: Whisper: A small collet lathe
---

<p>For quite some time now I have wanted to make myself a small lathe. Of higher-quality than the 7xx series mini-lathes, but larger (especially in the spindle bore) than the Sherline or Taig lathes.</p>

<p>With this bubbling away at the back of my brain I suddenly had an idea! Why not make a small lathe that used ER32 collets? They're readily available, accurate and strong, and most of the work I do is with round bars. Ideally I could fit a chuck as well, but as this first lathe is mainly an experiment being limited to collets would not be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Additionally to keep things simple and to keep costs down I thought I would use plain bearings in my spindle, rather than ball or roller bearings like most modern lathes do. This would allow me to keep the headstock bore small and easily machinable while simultaneously allowing a decent bore through the spindle. I established my minimum acceptable spindle bore to be 3/4" which nicely matches the largest ER32 collet.</p>

<h2>Goals and specifications:</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bore through spindle: 0.75"</li>
    <li>Swing over cross-slide: 2"</li>
    <li>Distance between centres: 6"</li>
    <li>Spindle speed: 50 - 1500RPM (Continuously variable)</li>
    <li>Spindle motor output: 300 watts or greater</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Research:</h2>

<p>Given that making a lathe from scratch requires a number of parts that aren't commonly machined in the small shop, I thought I had better do some research. Below are links to the web-pages that I found useful:</p>
