title: Carriage Leadscrew for the Mini-Lathe
---

<p>After a few weeks of using my mini-lathe (7x12") there were definitely a few things about it that were getting on my nerves. The two most serious things being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The high ratio of the rack and pinion gearing used for moving the carriage</li>
  <li>The close proximity of the carriage handwheel to the cross-slide handwheel</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to fix both these problems I decided to mount an ACME leadscrew along the length of the bed for moving the carriage, and have a handwheel at the tailstock end of the bed much like the small Sherline lathes do.</p>

<h2>Design considerations:</h2>

<p>A length of ACME leadscrew is a much less rigid thing than a rack gear mounted straight to the lathe bed, so in order to combat this the leadscrew needs to be kept in tension as much as possible. This dictated that the thrust bearings for the leadscrew should be mounted at the headstock end of the lathe as most turning operations are done moving towards the headstock.</p>

<p>Apart from this one main consideration the design of the leadscrew and bearing blocks is a relatively straightforward thing. The leadscrew should be restrained from moving either radially or axially, and as the cutting loads are high on a lathe this dictated I would need to use proper thrust bearings in addition to radial ball bearings.</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>For the most part the existing leadscrew bearing holes were used. I re-drilled them with a #7 drill, then tapped them 1/4"-20. Tapping cast iron is lovely and smooth!</p>

<p>Two additional 1/4"-20 holes were drilled into the side of the apron to allow mounting of the leadscrew nut.</p>

<p>The bearing are installed into the bearing blocks, then the blocks are glued together, trapping the bearings inside. The bearing blocks were then loosely fitted onto the lathe. The leadscrew was installed, then the bearing blocks were tightened down once the two blocks and the leadscrew nut were aligned.</p>

<p>Next the thrust bearings were pre-loaded using 1/2"-10 ACME nuts at the headstock end. Once the handwheel is fitted the whole assembly is good to go!</p>

<h2>Result:</h2>

<p>The system has seen quite a lot of use over the last two months or so and has so far proven reliable. You'll notice from the photos that I used Birch plywood as the material for all the parts, this was mainly because it was the easiest thing to cut on my CNC router. Because of the short spans involved it has proven to be more than rigid enough for the task.</p>

<h2>Files:</h2>
<p>The ZIP file below contains SketchUp, DWG and Gcode files for the leadscrew brackets and the nut retainer. I would not recommend using the Gcode files as-is, but if you don't have CAM software then they may be of some use.</p>

<h2>Bill of materials:</h2>
<p>I used what I had on hand, but you could easily substitute much cheaper ACME threaded rod, provided you are able to source a good nut for it.</p>
