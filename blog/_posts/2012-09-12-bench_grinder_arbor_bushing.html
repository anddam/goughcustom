title: A Bench Grinder Arbor Bushing
---

<p>When replacing my grinder's wheels the other day I discovered that the flanges on the arbors were very cheap and inaccurate metal stampings. Because of this I couldn't get the grinder wheel balanced correctly. After messing about trying to balance them using shims for half an hour I threw in the towel and decided to make a new bushing/flange for the arbor.</p>

<p>The drawings and stock, along with the original part for comparison.</p>

<p>Facing the inside of the flange, and relieving the flange so that the pressure on the wheel is away from the mounting hole.</p>

<p>The bushing is grooved to indicate where the bandsaw should part it from the bar.</p>

<p>The bushing is parted off, re-chucked and ready for facing.</p>

<p>There was no particular goal with posting these photos. It's a simple part but I like the way it turned out, so I thought I would post the photos here!</p>
