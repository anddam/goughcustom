title: New Workshop Space
---

<p>The shared workshop I rent space in had a slightly larger space come available, and I decided to go for it! Being in the middle of a major city, I have to compromise a lot in terms of how much space I get. It's no warehouse that's for sure! I'm still very surprised at how much you can fit into a space if you try!</p>

<p>Soon I will be making banks of small drawers to go under each bench. I've found that the large containers are great for stuff you don't use very often, but if you use the contents often you will never be able to find anything as there is no way of organizing the space within the container that isn't agonizing...</p>
