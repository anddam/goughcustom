title: Tooling up for pen production
---

<p>I've spent the last few weeks making jigs and tooling to help speed up the production of the EDC pen. I will be making 200 of these so any speed-up is a welcome thing! Below is a selection of the tooling I've made or bought for producing the pens:</p>

<p>Multiple drill chucks make changing drills much faster, not as fast as using a turret but as I don't have access to a turret lathe I have to make do! On the right is a thread-die holder which fits in the tailstock of the lathe. When used with the hand-crank that I bought for the spindle it makes threading the bodies of the pens much, much easier. I also made custom depth-stop rings for all the drills that I use in producing the pen, which makes drilling all the required holes much faster.</p>

<p>The most interesting tool I made is the double grooving tool you can see below. The tool is designed to cut a pair of O-ring grooves in a single go. It works very well and ensures that the spacing between the O-rings is always consistent. It was made by creating form tools from 2 1/8" tool blanks, then making a carrier for the tool blanks that spaces them apart the correct amount.</p>

<p>I also made a simple chamfer tool which puts a much cleaner chamfer on the parts than using a file would. It's faster too which is nice.</p>


<p>One of the last things I did was to build a stand for the lathe which is designed to help contain the mess of chips, and to make chips much easier to dispose of. It's all made of 5/8" MDF, and the chip chute on the right was made from a piece of aluminum sheet with the help of some shears and the vice. I used the lathe in it's new home for the first time today and everything went very smoothly. Clean-up is almost unecessary with the new stand which is great!</p>

<p>If anyone else is looking for a way to contain the mess made by a mini-lathe I highly recommend this kind of stand, it's quick to make using just the tablesaw and works really well!</p>

<p>And last, but not least, I made a series of blocks, using the CNC router, designed to hold the various parts of the pens as they pass through the various stages of production. Each block holds 210 pens to allow for some parts that don't pass quality control.</p>
