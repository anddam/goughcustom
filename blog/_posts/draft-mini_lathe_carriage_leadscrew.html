title: Carriage Leadscrew for the Mini-Lathe
---

<p>After a few weeks of using my mini-lathe (7x12") there were definitely a few things about
it that were getting on my nerves. The two most serious things being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The high ratio of the rack and pinion gearing used for moving the carriage; it was nearly 
  impossible to get a good finish because the carriage would jerk and jump, and the feedrate 
  always wanted to be too high.</li>
  <li>The close proximity of the carriage handwheel to the cross-slide handwheel. When using the
  carriage handwheel I would always be bumping into the cross-slide handwheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to fix both these problems I decided to mount an ACME leadscrew along the length of the bed
for moving the carriage, and have a handwheel at the end of the bed much like the small Sherline
lathes do.</p>

<h2>Design considerations:</h2>

<p>A length of ACME leadscrew is a much less rigid thing than a rack gear mounted straight to the lathe
bed, so in order to combat this I realized the leadscrew would have to be kept in tension as much as possible. 
This dictated that the thrust bearings for the leadscrew should be mounted at the headstock end of the 
lathe as most turning operations are done moving towards the headstock as opposed to away.</p>

<p>Apart from this one main consideration the design of the leadscrew and bearing blocks is a relatively straightforward thing. The leadscrew should be restrained from moving either radially or axially, and as the cutting loads are high on a lathe this dictated I would need to use proper thrust bearings in addition to radial ball bearings.</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>For the most part the existing leadscrew bearing holes were used. I re-drilled them with a #7 drill, then tapped them 1/4-20. Tapping cast iron is lovely and smooth!</p>

<p>Two additional 1/4-20 holes were drilled into the side of the apron to allow mounting of the leadscrew nut.</p>

<p>The bearing are installed into the bearing blocks, then the blocks are glued together, trapping the bearings inside. The bearing blocks were then loosely fitted onto the lathe. The leadscrew was installed, then the bearing blocks were tightened down once the two blocks and the leadscrew nut were aligned.</p>

<p>Next the thrust bearings were pre-loaded using 1/2-10 ACME nuts at the headstock end. Once the handwheel is fitted the whole assembly is good to go!</p>

<h2>Result:</h2>

<p>So far the whole assembly has proved reliable. The leadscrew does not needed to be oiled as I'm using a Delrin nut and this means that swarf does not stick to it which is very nice.</p>
