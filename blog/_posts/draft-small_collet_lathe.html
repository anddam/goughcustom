title: Whisper: A small collet lathe
---

<p>For quite some time now I have wanted to make myself a small lathe. Of higher-quality than the 7xx series mini-lathes, but larger (especially in the spindle bore) than the Sherline or Taig lathes.</p>

<p>With this bubbling away at the back of my brain I suddenly had an idea! Why not make a small lathe that used ER32 collets? They're readily available, accurate and strong, and most of the work I do is with round bars. Ideally I could fit a chuck as well, but as this first lathe is mainly an experiment being limited to collets would not be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Looking around eBay I was able to find many ER32 collet chucks with long, straight, precision-ground shanks. A collet chuck like this is basically already a spindle; in the simplest form you could just wrap some bearings around that shaft and use it nearly as-is. My plan was to get a little more sophisticated though, I found a collet chuck with a 1.25" diameter shank that matched the readily available tapered roller bearings from VXB. If I anneal the rear portion of the collet chuck's shank, I can thread it so as to provide a mechanism for pre-loading the roller bearings and retaining a pulley for driving the spindle. The collet chuck are quite inexpensive (around $60 including shipping) and a full set of collets is not much more. To get the maximum capacity out of the collet chuck I planned to expand the thru-bore from its standard 16mm size up to 0.8" which is just larger than the largest diameter an ER32 collet can hold.</p>

<h2>Goals and specifications:</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bore through spindle: 0.8"</li>
    <li>Swing over cross-slide: 2"</li>
    <li>Distance between centres: 6"</li>
    <li>Spindle speed: 50 - 5000RPM (Continuously variable)</li>
    <li>Spindle motor output: 300 watts or greater</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Research:</h2>

<p>Given that making a lathe from scratch requires a number of parts that aren't commonly machined in the small shop, I thought I had better do some research. Below are links to the web-pages that I found useful:</p>
