<h1>Blog</h1>

<p>This blog is a place where I can post information about prototypes and experiments as I work
on them. Where possible I try to post enough information to allow other people to replicate the
things that I document in the blog. If you want more information about a particular item please
feel free to <a href="/contact.html">Contact Me.</a></p>

<ul id="blog_list">
  {% for post in site.categories.blog %}
  <li>{{ forloop.length | minus:forloop.index0 }} - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
