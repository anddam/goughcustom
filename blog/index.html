<h1>Behind The Scenes</h1>

<p>This is a place where I can share the lessons learnt during the various projects that I work on. Given the decline of trade skills occurring in most first-world countries I think it is important to disseminate this information as widely as possible.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>It's surprisingly hard these days to 'just go somewhere' and learn basic machine skills, particularly if you can only do so on a part-time basis. There are still a number of woodworking courses and schools around, but the metal trades seem to have largely evaporated.</p> 

<p>In order to help combat this I offer people from all walks of life the chance to come in and spend time with me in my shop. Whether you want to learn woodworking, metalworking or even CAD/CAM/CNC the equipment and know-how are all here. <a href="/contact.html">Contact me</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Resource List</h2>

<p>This list is a shortcut to the suppliers that I use and trust, as well as a library of useful links and information collected from other sites. Check it out here: <a href="/resources.html">Resource List</a></p>
