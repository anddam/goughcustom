<div class="tagline">Design. &nbsp; Invent. &nbsp; Create.</div>

<p>Modern consumer products are complicated many-layered things, and designing them has become a multi-disciplinary affair involving elements of graphic and industrial design, electronic engineering, computer programming and user interface design. Because of this complexity it has become much more difficult for individuals and companies to source custom designed products produced in small batches, much less custom one-offs.</p>

<p>This is where I come in. Over many years I have acquired a diverse range of skills and experience covering all the major points involved in the design of a sophisticated modern product.</p>
