%h1 Ordering Info

.notice 
  %h2 Please note: Orders are currently closed...
  
  %p Due to the overwhelming number of orders I have been receiving I have had to stop taking them for the time being in order to catch up. I'll probably start taking orders again sometime around August 2014. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank-you for all your support!
  
  %p If you'd like to be updated when my order list is open again, and also get updates straight from my shop as I work on customer orders and build prototypes of new designs please sign up for my mailing list:

%p Because each knife that I make is made for a specific customer, my ordering process is a little different from that of a normal online retailer and unfortunately involves a bit of waiting.

%p The first step is to contact me via email with the following details:

%ul
  %li Your first and last name
  %li Your address
  %li The model of knife you would like
  %li What options you would like (handle color, blade finish, etc...)
  %li What you will be using the knife for
    
%p I like to talk to each of my customers individually rather than simply selling knives through a web-store, as it allows me to make sure that each customer is getting something that will serve their needs as well as possible.

%p Your name will then be added to the waiting list. <strong>No deposit is required!</strong> I do not require a deposit because I do not guarantee a specific delivery time, therefore I think it's only fair that you should not have to pay up-front.

%p Once your name has reached the top of the waiting list I will contact you again to confirm that you still want your order to go ahead, and give you a second chance to change the details of your order if you desire.

%p Once you have re-confirmed your order I will start work on your knife!

%h2 Payment:

%p I only require payment after you have seen photos of your finished knife. If you are happy then you will send through the payment and I will send the knife off to you! I currently only accept payment via PayPal. 

%h2 Returns:

%p If you receive the knife and are unhappy with it for any reason then you can send it back for a full refund any time in the first 30 days, no questions asked. 

%h2 Warranty:

%p I offer a full lifetime warranty on all my knives. If there is any failure in the materials or workmanship I will replace the knife free of charge. 

%p The only exception to this policy is damage caused by real abuse or 'testing'. My knives are designed to cut normal things, they are not designed to cut sheet metal or be used as a pry-bar. Sure, they can do these things, but the blade will likely sustain some level of damage. 

%p If you had to abuse your knife during a bona-fide emergency situation please send me an email explaining what happened and I will endeavour to repair or replace your knife free of charge.
    
%h2 Wait time:

%p The current wait time is: <strong>50+ weeks</strong>. Please note that I do not guarantee delivery times. This is because quality is my primary focus, and ensuring uncompromised quality can take time. To make up for my long wait times I do not require that you supply a deposit in order to place an order.

%h2 Price List:

%ul
  %li Resolute 2.5" - USD $225 + shipping
  %li Resolute 4"   - USD $300 + shipping
  %li Resolute 5"   - USD $375 + shipping
  
%h2 Shipping Costs:
  
%p The shipping prices and times below are estimates for shipping one knife to a given region, actual shipping costs will vary from area to area within that region but shouldn't differ by much. Shipping is with UPS and includes insurance, tracking and delivery confirmation.

%ul
  %li U.S.A (~6 days) - USD $32
  %li U.K. (~6 days) - USD $115
  %li Australia (~13 days) - USD $150
  %li E.U. (~8 days) - USD $120
  
%h2 Placing your order:

%p Please send me an email at <a href="mailto:aaron@goughcustom.com">aaron@goughcustom.com</a> with your order details as laid out above. 

%p I look forward to hearing from you!
