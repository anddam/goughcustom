    The Resolute camp, trail, and survival knife.

%h1.tagline Resolute

%p Humanity has been using knives in various forms for over 2 million years, their use is ingrained in every part of our culture, and there probably isn't an able-bodied human on earth that does not use a knife in some part of their daily life.

%p The Resolute camping / trail / survival knife was designed to be a 'jack-of-all-trades' knife for the outdoorsman. This knife will prepare food, butcher game, and split firewood with ease, as well as being able to chop, notch, and pry in a survival situation.

%p The blade is made from supremely tough O1 tool steel, which in my testing has been shown to be able to take more abuse than any reasonable person would want to put it through. The tang of the blade is tapered to remove unnecessary weight and improve balance, while the blade geometry itself is designed to be tough without sacrificing cutting ability.

%p The handle is made from an extremely durable and water-resistant composite material called G10. It's a high-pressure laminate made from fibreglass and epoxy resin. It's highly impact and UV resistant, is not affected by water exposure, provides great grip and cleans easily. The handle is attached to the tang of the blade with peened O1 steel pins and high-quality West Systems epoxy, ensuring that it will never fail when you need it.

%p The integrated window-breaker on the butt of the handle adds to the knife's utility in a survival situation while not detracting from grip comfort.

%p The thermoformed Kydex sheath retains the knife even under the most gruelling conditions without the need for cumbersome clips or straps, and offers a range of carry and mounting options including belt carry, inside the waistband carry, PALS/MOLLE compatibility, and more. 

%p Each knife is individually engraved with a serial number and my makers mark when it is completed.

%h2 Options

%p The Resolute comes in two sizes, regular and extra-large. The main difference between the two is the handle size. Some people, men in particular, have very large hands and have a hard time finding knives that are comfortable. The XL model is made to suit those requirements. If you find that most everyday object feel too small to you then order the XL version, otherwise order the regular version.

%p Customers also have the option to choose different colors for the handle scales on their knife. The handle can be a solid color (like you see on the brown-handled knife below), or it can have contrasting liners (like seen on the tan and red knife below). Handles are only available in G10 as I believe it's the best material for the job. There are a number of colors available:

%h2 Ordering

%p I don't keep any knives in stock, as they're each made to meet individual customer requirements. Because I only make knives part-time it's very hard for me to give you an exact time of delivery for the knife. So instead each customer is added to the  production list in order, when I am able to start work on your knife I contact you to re-confirm your order, then I make the knife to your specifications. Wait time is about 2-4 weeks per person on the list (approx 20-30 weeks right now). However I do not guarantee delivery dates. This is because making each knife takes quite a while, and I want to make sure that I have enough time to make each knife to meet my exacting personal standards.

%p Below is a video of a Resolute knife being made, this knife was made for a US Army Infantryman who has since taken it with him to Afghanistan. The process of making each knife is different as I evolve and refine my methods, but this video captures the overall nature of the process very well.
